Apache TVM is a compiler stack for deep learning systems. It is designed to close the gap between the
productivity-focused deep learning frameworks, and the performance- and efficiency-focused hardware backends. TVM works with deep learning frameworks to provide end to end compilation to different backends.

This version of TVM enables the use of **Bayesian Optimization** as a search strategy in MetaSchedule.

## Getting Started
We recommend following [this guide](https://llm.mlc.ai/docs/install/tvm.html) when installing TVM.
